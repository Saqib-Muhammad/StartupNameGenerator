# startup_namer

Flutter project.

A simple mobile Flutter app.

App that generates proposed names for a startup company. The user can select and unselect names, saving the best ones. The code lazily generates 10 names at a time. As the user scrolls, more names are generated. There is no limit to how far a user can scroll.

The following animated GIF shows how the app works:
